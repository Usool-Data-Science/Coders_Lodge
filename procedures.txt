1. create the backend dir, then venv as well as app.py, db.py and models.py inside it.
2. install flask, flask-cors and flask-sqlalchemy python-dotenv
3. create the CRUD logic inside the routes, import the route inside the app to connect them.
4. Deactivate the venv and do git init in the root directory.
5. populate your .gitignore file to ensure you are not keeping track of too much files.

For the frontend create the react app using either:
npm create vite@latest . # or npm create-react-app <app-name>

Remove all boilerplate codes and start your development.
go to chakra ui `get started` and follow the vite guide

Design your frontend and then connect both together.

Go to the backend and then run your app again and test to receive friends.
Now we want to deploy. we will ensure that our client (which is currently on port 3000)
is served at the root path of our server(localhost:5000/)

so we will firstly run in the frontend folder:
npm run build to get the (dist folder) optimized version of our app

Then in your app.py grab the frontend folder and serve it under the port 5000 to be the index path.

Then create a  wsgi.py to run the app in the backend and the requirements.txt
